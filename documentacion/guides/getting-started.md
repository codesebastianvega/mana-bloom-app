# Getting Started with Mana Bloom

> **Project:** Mana Bloom - Productivity Gamification App
> **Stack:** Expo 54 / RN 0.81 / React 19
> **Last Updated:** 2025-11-23

## 🌸 What is Mana Bloom?

Mana Bloom is a productivity application that gamifies your daily tasks. By completing tasks, you nurture a virtual plant, earn resources (Mana, Coins, Gems), and unlock magical rewards. It combines habit tracking with a relaxing, magical atmosphere.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. **Run on device/emulator:**
   - Press `a` for Android
   - Press `i` for iOS (Mac only)
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`src/screens`**: Main application screens (`HomeScreen`, `PlantScreen`, `TasksScreen`, etc.).
- **`src/components`**: Reusable UI components organized by domain:
  - `home/`: Home screen specific components
  - `plant/`: Plant screen components
  - `common/`: Shared components (buttons, cards)
- **`src/state`**: Global state management (`AppContext.js`).
- **`src/theme.js`**: Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography).
- **`src/lib`**: Utilities and external services (Supabase, Sync).
- **`docs/`**: Project documentation.

## 🎮 Key Mechanics

### Economy
- **Mana (💧)**: Generated by tasks, used to water/care for the plant.
- **Coins (🪙)**: Earned by challenges, used in the shop.
- **Gems (💎)**: Premium currency for special items.

### Plant Care
- **Growth**: The plant evolves based on your productivity (XP).
- **Care Actions**: Water, Prune, and Fertilize your plant using Mana.
- **Rituals**: Special actions like "Meditate" that provide buffs.

### Daily Challenges
- 3 random challenges generated daily.
- Completing them grants XP and Mana.
- See [Daily Challenges Docs](../components/home/DailyChallenges.md).

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- We use `AppContext` for global state (User, Plant, Economy).
- Data is persisted using `AsyncStorage`.
- See [State Management](../architecture/state-management.md).

### UI/UX
- **Glassmorphism**: Heavy use of translucent backgrounds and blurs.
- **Dark Mode**: The app is designed with a dark, magical theme.
- **Components**: We prefer creating small, focused components in subdirectories.
